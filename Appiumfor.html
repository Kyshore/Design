              <p class="col-md-12 fs-4">Appium is used mostly in the field of software test automation, to help determine whether the functionality of a given app is working as expected. In contrast to other types of software testing, UI automation allows testers to write code that walks through user scenarios in the actual UI of an application, mimicking as closely as possible what happens in the real world while enabling the various benefits of automation, including speed, scale, and consistency.</p>

              <p class="col-md-12 fs-4"> Appium aims to provide a set of tools that support this kind of automation in a standard way across any number of platforms. Most platforms come with tools that allow UI automation at some level, but these are usually platform-specific and require specialized knowledge and specific programming language experience and toolchains. Appium tries to unify all these automation technology under a single stable interface, accessible via most popular programming languages (you can write Appium scripts in Java, Python, Ruby, JS, and more)</p>

              <p class="text-primary">To learn more about how Appium accomplishes this goal, and the various components involved, have a read through our Introduction</p>

                <h2>Appium Philosophy</h2>
                <p id="newone" style="height: 70px;">Appium is an open-source tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows desktop platforms.
                    <ul style="height: 185px;">
                        <li>Native apps are created for one specific platform or operating system.</li>
                        <li>Web apps are responsive versions of websites that can work on any mobile device or OS because they’re delivered using a mobile browser.</li>
                        <li>Hybrid apps are combinations of both native and web apps, but wrapped within a native app, giving it the ability to have its own icon or be downloaded from an app store.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Appium was designed to meet mobile automation needs according to a philosophy outlined by the following four tenets:<br><br>

                    <ul style="height: 200px;">
                        <li>You shouldn't have to recompile your app or modify it in any way in order to automate it.</li>
                        <li>You shouldn't be locked into a specific language or framework to write and run your tests.</li>
                        <li>A mobile automation framework shouldn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to automation APIs</li>
                        <li>A mobile automation framework should be open source, in spirit and practice as well as in name!</li>
                    </ul>
                    Importantly, Appium is "cross-platform": it allows you to write tests against multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows), using the same API. This enables code reuse between iOS, Android, and Windows test suites.

                  <h2>Appium Design</h2>
                  <p style="height: 50px;">So how does the structure of the Appium project live out this philosophy? 
                      <ul>
                          <li><mark>Requirement #1</mark> by using vendor-provided automation frameworks under the hood. That way, we don't need to compile in any Appium-specific or third-party code or frameworks to your app. This means you're testing the same app you're shipping.</li>
                          <li><mark>Requirement #2</mark> by wrapping the vendor-provided frameworks in one API, the WebDriver API ("Selenium WebDriver") specifies a client-server protocol (known as the JSON Wire Protocol). Given this client-server architecture, a client written in any language can be used to send the appropriate HTTP requests to the server. This also means that you're free to use whatever test runner and test framework you want; the client libraries are simply HTTP clients and can be mixed into your code any way you please. In other words, Appium & WebDriver clients are not technically "test frameworks" -- they are "automation libraries". You can manage your test environment any way you like!</li>
                          <li><mark>Requirement #3</mark> in the same way: WebDriver has become the de facto standard for automating web browsers and is a W3C Working Draft. Why do something totally different for mobile? Instead we have extended the protocol with extra API methods useful for mobile automation.</li>
                          <li>
                            It should be obvious that <mark>Requirement #4</mark> is a given -- you're reading this because Appium is open source.
                            </li>
                      
                  </ul></p>
