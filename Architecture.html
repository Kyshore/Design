                After writing test cases in Appium and executing them, the app will run automatically on the connected device and show the user interactions written in a test case.
            
                Test scripts can automate actions such as the clicking of a sign-in button as if a real user were interacting with the app.

                Appium is a web server that uses the WebDriver protocol. This protocol was invented by Selenium, which is an automated software that's also used for mobile automation.<br>
                
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In fact, the WebDriver protocol became so popular that it was included in every web browser by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C is the governing committee for HTML, CSS, and web browsers. So, now this protocol is included in all major browsers by default.

                How Does the Appium Server Work?

                <p class="fs-5 mb-4 lh-sm text-start">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                
                    The client program for Appium is written in a variety of languages. This code is converted into HTTP requests by the client program. Then, they're sent to the Appium server, which either runs locally or remotely.<br>
                
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Appium server interprets the requests and forwards them to the WebDriver. Then, the WebDriver runs these commands on the attached physical device or emulator. As mentioned earlier, these interactions seem like real user interactions.<br>
                
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp After this, the test results are sent back to the Appium server, which produces test status logs.

                    The WebDriver protocol is central in Appium. It was originally designed to automate the browser. And it's used in Selenium, on which Appium is based. It gives us access to some commands, which can emulate the user behavior. The behaviors like clicking or swiping can be done with WebDriver.<br>
                
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This protocol understands only the GET, DELETE, and POST methods of RESTful APIs. It's used to execute user interaction and other things on the attached physical device or emulator.<br>
                
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The WebDriver protocol receives information generally in a POST request. Here, in the body of the POST request, it receives the JSON object containing information.<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It also receives important information about desired capabilities in the JSON object.<br>

                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Appium is mainly the server, which is written in the JavaScript server-side framework of NodeJS.

                Client-Server Communication
            </p>

                    Appium is mainly the server, which is written in the JavaScript server-side framework of NodeJS. Client-server communication forms a major part of Appium.<br>
                
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As mentioned earlier, client-side programming can be done in a variety of languages, and the client sends a request to the server via JSON objects. The client-server follows the typical client-server architecture. And all the communications are done via a request-and-response mechanism.<br>
                
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp JSON (JavaScript object notation) is also the way data is passed between web browser and server when we use the internet.<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It also receives important information about desired capabilities in the JSON object.<br>

                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                The Appium server is a web server that communicates via JSON objects. It uses a special protocol created by Selenium called JSON wire protocol, which we will learn later. Whenever a client request is made, it's processed by the Appium server and then sent to the WebDriver for execution on a connected mobile. It also sends back the results of the test to the client program.

                    Whenever the first client request is sent from the client to the server, a session is created. All of the subsequent requests are given a session ID, and this separates each test.<br>

                    Appium uses a modified version of the JSON wire protocol called the mobile JSON wire protocol. It's created on top of the Selenium JSON wire protocol. This is used to communicate between the client and the server. Additionally, it's actually a set of API endpoints in the server. These API endpoints are RESTful. They're a handful and predefined.<br>
                                    
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                When a client wants to send some data to the server, the client program converts it into a JSON object. Then, it's sent to the server, which does its tasks. After that, the response is sent to the client.

                    Appium's main part is the server, and this server is written in the server-side framework of Node.js. The client programming is written in different languages, and it communicates with the Appium server using mobile JSON wire protocol.<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When the first request is sent from the client, it includes desired capabilities. It also contains all information about the connection, like the APK file, platform, and mobile device being used.<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The first call is a <kbd>POST</kbd> request to the endpoint <kbd>/wd/hub/session</kbd>. Here, the Appium server creates a unique session ID and uses it throughout the session until the testing is done.<br>
                                    
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
                However, Appium works in a different way in Android and iOS. Let's look into that in detail now.</p>

                <p>In Android devices, we have a UI Automator framework. This is used by Appium to perform the interactions on the connected Android device or emulator. The steps, as shown in the figure below, are performed in this order:

                        <li>The test commands written by the user are converted by the underlying client libraries. Then, they're sent to the Appium server as a JSON object through the mobile JSON wire protocol.</li>
